<h1>About</h1>

<p>The High‑Value Data Network (HVDNet) is an open initiative to make high‑value data equally discoverable, accessible, and usable by humans and machines. We complement existing data platforms with standards‑based metadata and modern, well‑documented APIs aligned with the <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAIR principles</a>.</p>

<h2>Leadership</h2>
<p>This initiative is led by <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/pascal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pascal Heus</a>, freelancer, open‑source developer, and member of the CODATA <a href="https://cdif.codata.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cross Domain Interoperability Framework (CDIF)</a> and <a href="https://codata.org/initiatives/task-groups/drum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Representation of Units of Measurement (DRUM)</a> working groups.</p>

<h2>Support & Partnerships</h2>
<p>The project is supported by <a href="https://codata.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CODATA</a> and a growing network of technology, strategic, and data partners. We are grateful to <a href="https://postman.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Postman</a> for its support during our inception phase.</p>
