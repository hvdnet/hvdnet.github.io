# HVDNet Data Hosting

Thanks to our partner [Metadata Technology North America (MTNA)](https://www.mtna.us){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, we host our own [Rich Data Services](https://www.richdataservices.com){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} server which you can access at [https://rds.highvaluedata.net/rds](https://rds.highvaluedata.net/rds){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. We use this server with pilot datasets to demonstrate the benefits of delivering high-value data over APIs as well as a public services.

While we generally encourage data publishers to deploy API driven data and metadata services on their own infrastructure, we are happy to host datasets for evalutaion / proof of concept purposes or for the greater good of user communities. Contact us with your use case for more information.
