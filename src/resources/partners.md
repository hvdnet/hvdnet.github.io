# Partners

Our work is inherently collaborative, relying on the engagement of stakeholders from diverse sectors and communities. 

We welcome a wide range of partners, each playing a unique role:

- **Strategic Partners:** Organizations, companies, or standard-setting bodies that provide support, advocacy, and help drive our mission forward.
- **Data Partners:** Data custodians and producers looking to modernize their infrastructure and make their datasets FAIR, increasing accessibility and impact.
- **Technology Partners:** Companies or open source initiatives that contribute essential technologies, platforms, or infrastructure to enable innovation and integration.
- **Communities:** Networks of data users, researchers, developers, and advocates who foster collaboration, share expertise, and advance data-driven solutions.

Partnerships are vital to the success of this project. If you are interested in becoming a partner, please contact us. The process is straightforward and informal, and comes with perks and benefits.
