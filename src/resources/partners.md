# Partners

Our work is inherently collaborative, relying on the engagement of stakeholders from diverse sectors and communities. Partnerships are vital to the success of this project. If you are interested in becoming a partner, please contact usâ€”the process is straightforward and informal.

## Strategic Partners{.mt-4 strategic}

Strategic partners are large public or private sector organizations, or standard-setting agencies and initiatives, that play a pivotal role in advancing our mission. They provide in-kind or financial support, assist with outreach and advocacy, help organize events, and collaborate on joint projects to drive meaningful impact.

## Data Partners{.mt-4 #data}

Data partners are high-value data custodians who share our vision and are committed to modernizing their infrastructure and making their data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable). These partners include data producers, data archives, government agencies, and international organizations. They play a crucial role by providing access to valuable data and documentation, and often serve as early adopters of our tools, platforms, recommended technologies, and best practices.
