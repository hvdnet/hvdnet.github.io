      <h1>Standards and Best Practices</h1>
<h2>Guiding Principles</h2>
<p>Machine-actionable metadata is essential for enabling data scientists, developers, APIs, and AI systems to efficiently discover, access, and utilize data resources. As the volume and complexity of data continue to grow, ensuring that metadata is both human- and machine-readable becomes critical for supporting automation, interoperability, and advanced analytics.</p>
<p>Our project is guided by the <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/">FAIR data principles</a> - emphasizing Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability — which provide a framework for making data and metadata more useful and actionable across diverse platforms and communities. In addition, we align with the <a href="https://cdif.codata.org">CODATA cross-domain integration framework (CDIF)</a> recommendations, which emphasize the harmonization of metadata standards and practices to facilitate seamless data exchange and integration across scientific and technical domains. By adopting these principles, we aim to foster a robust data ecosystem that supports innovation, collaboration, and reproducibility.</p>
<h2>Domain Standards</h2>
<p>Our project leverages the FAIR and CDIF standards as foundational frameworks for metadata management and data interoperability. By implementing these standards, we ensure that our metadata is structured, discoverable, and reusable across domains.
